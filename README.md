# Scale-Adaptive Fitness Evaluation (SAFE)
This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the SAFE method tailored for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Occasional Couriers (CVRP-OC). This method addresses a complex variant of the classic CVRP and has been discussed in detail in the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation.

The original implementation presented unique challenges due to its unconventional coding style, which affected code readability and maintainability. We have dedicated significant effort to refactor the codebase, aiming to enhance clarity and understanding for potential users.

Despite our efforts to ensure reliability and performance, the complexity of the SAFE may lead to unexpected behavior. We welcome any contributions from the community, especially in identifying and resolving any issues. Should you encounter bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please do not hesitate to submit an issue or contact the maintainers directly.
